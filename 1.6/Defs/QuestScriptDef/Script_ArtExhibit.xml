This is a great opportunity for noble gossip and to build relations with other members of the imperial nobility.\nYou are required to have a gallery present in your colony. If at any point the gallery is destroyed, the art exhibition will be called off.\n[asker_nameFull] has forwarded you a list of nobility that was invited to the exhibit and will arrive in the shuttle:\n[noblesDetailList]\n\nYou will need to make sure the guests are safe and comfortable during the exhibition. If anything happens to any of the guests, the art exhibition will be cancelled.\nDeserters might use this opportunity to launch an assassination attempt.
